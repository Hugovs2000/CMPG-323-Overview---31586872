# CMPG-323-Overview---31586872

## Repositories for Projects:
### Project 2: https://github.com/Hugovs2000/CMPG-323-Project-2---31586872.git
This repo contains the files of the connectedOffice API solution which is for CMPG323 Project 2. The API is hosted on Azure using an API management service and is connected to a database hosted on Azure as well. The purpose of the API is to manipulate the three tables (categories, devices, and zones) using HTTP methods implemented with the swaggerUI. The appsettings.json file provided does not contain the correct connection string as it contains sensitive information. Your own connection string must be entered if you wish to use the API locally.

## Branching Strategies:
- For each project a Main branch will be used to host the most current version.
- There will be a Develop branch which will be used to make changes.
- The two branches will be merged to form the most current version.

## .gitignore file uses:
### Project 2: 

The .gitignore file was used to ignore the appsettings.json file since it contains the connection string to the database used which also contains the username and password of the connection.

### Project 3: 

The .gitignore file is in the visual studio iteration where it ignores the necessary visual studio files and it is also altered to ignore the appsettings.json file which contains the connection string of the database used.

### Project 4:

No .gitignore file was used for this project as no sensitive information had to be stored.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information:
Credentials and sensitive information will be stored by encrypting the password when storing it in the database and decrypting it when needed. Other sensitive information can be added onto the .gitignore to be ignored when committing the work.
