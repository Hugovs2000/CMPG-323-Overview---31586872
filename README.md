## Branching Strategies:
- For each project a Main branch will be used to host the most current version.
- There will be a Develop branch which will be used to make changes.
- The two branches will be merged to form the most current version.

## .gitignore file uses:
The .gitignore file will be used to specify which documents will be ignored
by Git making it possible to have a text document which holds sensitive
information to go unseen for example.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information:
Credentials and sensitive information can be stored in any form for example a
text document which will be specified in the .gitignore file and therefore be 
hidden from other users.
